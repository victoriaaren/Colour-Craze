# Colour-Craze
JavaScript, CSS, HTML. User interactive web-based game that displays an RBG triplet, and coloured squares with one square being of the displayed colour. The user has to guess which square is the same colour as the given RBG colour to win. There's an easy mode, and a hard mode, as well as a 'Play Again' button incorporated as well.
